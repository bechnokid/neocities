          <h1>The Sanctum Sanctorum</h1>
          <p>Welcome! You've entered a shrine dedicated to Doctor Strange, most notably his MCU incarnation.</p>
          <h2>Who is Doctor Strange?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Doctor Stephen Strange</b> is a Marvel superhero and a Master of the Mystic Arts who first appeared in <i>Strange Tales #110</i> in July 1963.</p>
          <p>Yes, he <i>is</i> an actual doctor!</p>
          <p>He was a skilled and arrogant neurosurgeon until a horrific car accident left him with permanent nerve damage in his hands, promptly ending his career. He then travels to Tibet (Nepal in the MCU) to seek a cure that will heal his hands, and meets a wise sorcerer called the Ancient One who teaches him magic.</p>
          <p>Although Stephen can never return to his previous job as a surgeon, he instead finds a new purpose as a Master of the Mystic Arts, and uses his newfound magical powers to protect the world from mystical threats.</p>
          <h2>History with Doctor Strange</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>I was actually never interested in Doctor Strange until May 2022, when I saw <i>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</i> in theaters. I actually only watched it because I just happened to finish <i>Wandavision</i> and I thought, <i>"Oh hey! I might not actually be confused in this one!"</i> I still got confused, but I enjoyed the story and Stephen's character.</p>
          <p>However, Doctor Strange did not become a primary interest until I embarked on a Disney Magic Cruise at the end of August 2022, where I saw the same film <b>five times</b> in one of the cruises's numerous theaters as well as the 2016 film in the room I stayed in. After returning home, I completed my personal goal of watching every MCU film he appeared in.</p>
          <p>I guess you can say I now have a...<i>Strange</i> addiction. ;)</p>
