          <h1>The Sanctum Sanctorum</h1>
          <p>Welcome! You've entered a shrine/fanpage dedicated to Doctor Strange, most notably his MCU incarnation.</p>
          <p>While Stephen is an important character in the Marvel universe, he definitely isn't in the spotlight as much as his fellow Avengers or X-Men. So, I thought it would be nice to make a fanpage for the good doctor! Hope you enjoy your stay at the Sanctum...</p>
          <h2>Who is Doctor Strange?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange</b> is a Marvel superhero and a Master of the Mystic Arts who first appeared in <i>Strange Tales #110</i> in July 1963. Since then, he has made numerous appearances alongside other superheroes whenever they needed some help with magic.</p>
          <p>Yes, he <i>is</i> an actual doctor!</p>
          <p>He was a skilled but arrogant neurosurgeon until a horrific car accident left him with permanent nerve damage in his hands and promptly ended his career. Looking for a cure, he uses what remained in his dwindling savings to travel to Tibet (Nepal in the MCU), where meets a wise sorcerer called the Ancient One. Although skeptical about magic at first, Stephen eventually accepts the Ancient One's teachings and eventually becomes one of the most powerful sorcerers in the Marvel universe.</p>
          <p>Although Stephen can never return to his previous job as a surgeon, he instead finds a new purpose as a Master of the Mystic Arts, and uses his newfound magical powers to protect the world from mystical threats.</p>
          <p>Stephen has used a number of relics to help him with his duties as a sorcerer, but the two that have remained consistent between the comic books and the films are <b>the Eye of Agamotto</b>, which formerly contained the Time Stone until the events of <i>Endgame</i> and <b>the Cloak of Levitation</b>, who gained sentience in the MCU and has remained one of Stephen's most trusted partners.</p>
