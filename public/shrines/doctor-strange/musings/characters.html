          <h1>Musings || Characters</h1>
          <p>
            For a comic series that's been around since the 60's, it's no surprise that its characters would become beautifully complex over the years. Listed below are my thoughts on them. This page will continue to update as more characters are added.

            <h2>Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D.</h2>

            <p>Starting strong with the good doctor himself, and my favorite variant, too! Watching MoM for the first time without having any prior knowledge of the character except of his abilities in magic, I was surprised at how he used modern speech.</p>
            <p>To put it simply, I liked how he talked like any other guy and rarely used eloquent or poetic language like other sorcerers would, which honestly made him a much more interesting character to me than his comic counterpart. He also never called out the names of the spells he would cast, which is good because you should never shout your attacks before attacking an enemy lol</p>
            <p>I personally find Stephen to be a relatable character who is constantly improving and becoming a better person, which is something you don't often see in characters who are already established adults in their late 30s/early 40s. For Stephen, he was an accomplished neurosurgeon having gained a positive reputation. He would have been set for life, if not for the car accident. He's a perfect example that even as adults, we're always changing.</p>
            <p>Many DS fans would say that Stephen was incredibly nerfed in the MCU with the biggest complaint being that he doesn't have the title of "Sorcerer Supreme". I personally think this is a good thing since it gives Stephen more chances to keep learning and, again, it makes him a relatable character. He isn't perfect, and that's ok! Personally, I think his status as "Sorcerer Supreme" in the comics is what prevents him from learning from his mistakes, but that is something I will go into in another article.</p>
            <p>This is me going into fangirl mode, but I truly believe he is the <i>absolute cutest</i> character in the MCU. Perhaps it's because of his actor, Benedict Cumberbatch, or perhaps it's the choices the writers made in designing his character for the MCU films. Maybe it's both? Either way, he's adorable and I want to ruffle his hair.</p>

            <h2>The Cloak of Levitation</h2>
            <p><i>The Cloak will be referred to with masculine pronouns in this analysis.</i></p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Hello, bestie</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Despite being an important relic in the Doctor Strange comics, the Cloak of Levitation was never given a personality until Stephen's debut film in the MCU, which is honestly the best thing that happened. Again knowing nothing about Doctor Strange before watching MoM, I was surprised to learn that Cloak is sentient and can move and think on his own.</p>
            <p>After watched the films and familiarizing myself with the character, I honestly adore the concept of Stephen having a sentient cloak as his partner. Their relationship is rather unheard of, but not completely new, as similar relationships can be seen with Aladdin and the Magic Carpet from the Disney films, and Ryuko Matoi and Senketsu from Kill la Kill.</p>
            <p>Magical relics choose their wielders, and according to sorcerers, Cloak is a fickle thing. Forming a bond with him is no mere feat, indicating that no other sorcerer had been able to use the ancient relic until Stephen came into the picture. There's no given reason why Cloak chose Stephen as his partner; many have theorized that he "needed someone to match [his] own pettiness", and this is a theory that I personally hold onto.</p>
            <p>Although Stephen uses Cloak primarily as a tool, Stephen has shown to be kind to the relic, always talking to him with a soft voice, even when Cloak got on the sorcerer's nerves, and it's this kind of relationship that I enjoy so much. The two can butt heads sometimes, but overall, they have become inseparable and it's this interesting dynamic that got me and my wife hooked on the two, having come up with many different scenarios between the two. In fact, my wife is working on a fanfiction that involves a spell that turns Cloak into a human, and I hope people would be interested to read it when it is eventually posted online. :)</p>
