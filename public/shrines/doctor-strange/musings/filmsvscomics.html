          <h1>Musings || MCU vs. Comics</h1>
          <h2>Introduction</h2><hr>
          <p>I am a relatively new fan of Doctor Strange, having only started getting into the character and his story in mid-to-late 2022, but I like to think I have a good grasp on the lore to form my own opinions about it!</p>
          <p>I've read a small number of the comics, and whatever I couldn't read I would instead resort to analyses written by long-time Doctor Strange fans. Even with the large number of issues and always-fluctuating canons within the series, I still managed to learn about Stephen, his friends and foes, and the differences between them and their MCU counterparts.</p>
          <p>I've enjoyed the comics I've managed to read, but in the end <b>I still prefer Stephen's portrayal in the MCU than in the comics.</b> This isn't to say that the comics are bad by any means, nor am I trying to convince others to forgo the comics. In fact, I highly recommend 616stephenvs<i>*</i>'s' handy <a href="https://doctorofmagic.tumblr.com/post/187723606171/doctor-stranges-ultimate-reading-guide-beginner" target="_new">reading guide</a> if you want to start reading the comic books!</p>
          <p><i><small>* Their name is actually Sam, but I want to avoid confusion since they share the same name as my wife, so I'll be referring to them with their Twitter handle. Hopefully, that's ok!</small></i></p>
          <p>The only reason for writing this is to just to share my opinions, and because I really love talking about Doctor Strange.</p>
          <h2>Stephen as a Character</h2><hr>
          <p>I will preface this by saying that Stephen is great in both the comics and the films. However, I personally enjoy how Stephen is handled in the films better for a number of reasons. I've already gushed about him in my <a href="characters.html">short analysis of him</a> as a character in the MCU, but I'd also like to talk about how he compares to his comic book counterpart.</p>
          <p>I've mentioned in my analysis that I don't want Stephen to become Sorcerer Supreme in the films for several reasons, the main one being that inheriting the title could potentially prevent him from growing as a character, especially with his already large ego.</p>
