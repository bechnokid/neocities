After the passing of Ava (who will be mentioned below), I sought to create this shrine to help remember whichever small friend I had formed a close bond with in the hopes of dealing with grief.</p><div class="avalypuff p-3 rounded mt-4"><section><h2 id="ava-%22avalypuff%22" tabindex="-1">Ava &quot;Avalypuff&quot;</h2><figure class="figure-right mt-3 rounded p-2"><a href="/assets/images/shrines/rainbow/ava.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/shrines/rainbow/ava.jpg" alt="Ava on a checkered quilt, looking at the camera with her paws crossed"></a><figcaption><p>Ava on a checkered quilt, looking at the camera with her paws crossed</p></figcaption></figure><p class="h3 mt-2">April 4, 2009 - October 26, 2022</p><p>Ava, also known as Avalypuff, was a Border-Collie mix, the first dog that my wife Sam called hers and, technically, one of the two dogs I've owned in my life. I came into Ava's life in 2018 when I moved in with Sam and Dan. I never dogs and was often scared of them, but I <strong>loved</strong> that rascal. She was an old dog, but she still welcomed me into the family with her frequent smiles (that were usually followed by adorable sneezes).</p><p>She collapsed on the floor on October 26th from a ruptured tumor. I wasn't able to be there with her due to me being 45 minutes away at work with no way to get home since Sam drove me that morning. The last thing I got to say to her was during a phone call that she was a good dog and that I loved her.</p><p>I wish I could've been there for you, Ava. I wish I could've given you the pets that you deserved while at the hospital. You weren't even my dog, but you made me feel so welcome that I can't help but also see you as my dog. I'll miss you, you old rascal, and I hope you're celebrating up in heaven. When the time comes, I hope I'll see you there.</p><p>I love you, Ava.</p></section></div></section></main></div></div></body></html>
