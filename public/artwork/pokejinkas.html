            <p>"Gijinka" comes from the Japanese word 擬人化, meaning "humanization". So, Pokémon gijinkas are humanizations of, you guessed it, Pokémon! While many artists use Pokémon gijinkas as a way to demonstrate their character design skills, there are others that also use them as original characters, and I am no exception!</p>
