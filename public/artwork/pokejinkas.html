        <h1>Pokémon Gijinkas</h1>
        <p>"Gijinka" comes from the Japanese word 擬人化, meaning "humanization". So, Pokémon gijinkas are humanizations of, you guessed it, Pokémon! While many artists use Pokémon gijinkas as a way to demonstrate their character design skills, there are others that also use them as original characters, and I am no exception!</p>

Beloved mother and grandmother, Ramiera has always loved reading stories to her family. When she's not working at the library, she is usually seen participating in competitive battles! No one in her family has managed to best her in a battle.<br><br>(Aug 2022) Wow, I really didn't know how to color skintones...<br><br><i>Character:</i> Ramiera (shiny Gengar)<p></p></div><div class="glightbox-desc desc-4-2016"><p>I've been using a Kangaskhan in the Battle Maison for a while now, but I was never able to make a gijinka until I saw a "Dead Silence" a few days ago! Needless to say, I was inspired! And so, I introduce to you: Tria and Ven! Tria is a master ventriloquist who has performed in countless shows throughout the regions with her dummy, Ven who often causes trouble for their master!<br><br>The two are a hit, but not many people know much about Tria offstage. She wears a mysterious ring that holds a Kangaskhanite as its gem, which has perplexed her assistants and fans for a long time. She never had children of her own to use the Mega Stone with, so why does she have it? It remains a mystery...<br><br><i>Characters:</i> Tria (Kangaskhan), Ven (???)</p></div>
