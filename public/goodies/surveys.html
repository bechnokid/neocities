        <h1>Surveys</h1>
        <p>Back in the day of MySpace (or DeviantArt), we used to tell a little bit more about ourselves and share our experiences in the form of surveys! I'm still a pretty private person, so you'll find a lot of vague answers, but I hope you enjoy regardless!</p>
        <p>Links to the original surveys will be provided! :D</p><hr>
