            I've gotten a lot of questions over the years. Many of them are asked pretty often, which is why I created this page! If you have another question that you don't see on this page, feel free to email me at <b>bechnokid@yahoo.com</b>.<hr>
            <h2>Art</h2>
            <b>What kind of tools/software do you use for your art?</b>
            <p>Clip Studio Paint with an Intuos Bamboo CTH-480 tablet for drawing, and Photoscape for any final edits!</p>
            <b>When will you open commissions again?</b>
            <p>I'm not sure, but I always make a post on all my social media sites before opening commissions!</p>
            <b>Is there a way to support your work without commissioning you?</b>
            <p>I have a <a href='https://ko-fi.com/A34588W' target='_new'>Ko-fi</a> if you'd like to donate! Otherwise, you can support me by blogging/retweeting my artwork (Tumblr/Twitter) or sharing this website!</p>
            <b>Are you open for art trades/requests?</b>
            <p>Due to my limited time, I cannot take any more art trades or requests! I might take suggestions if they are related to my current interests, but that is a big <i>"might"</i>.</p>
            <b>Can I use your art for icons/headers/banners?</b>
            <p>Definitely! As long as it's fanart (excluding gift art and commissions) and you give proper c redit, such as providing a link back to any of my socials. The only thing I ask is that you don't use art that contain any of my own characters, fan or original!</p>
            <b>Can I trace your work?</b>
            <p>Sure, but only if it's for practice! All I ask is that you don't post it publicly.</p>
            <b>Can I draw fanart of your characters?</b>
            <p>Absolutely! &lt;3  All I ask is that you don't draw anything NSFW or fetish-related.</p>
            <b>Any chance you'll draw ______ again?</b>
            <p>It's not likely if it's something I haven't  drawn in a while since my interests tend to fluctuate a lot.</p><hr>
            <h2>Fandom</h2>
            <b>Have you watched/played/heard of ______?</b>
            <p>Maybe, or maybe not! I'd rather not be asked these kinds of questions!</p>
            <b>What do you think of ______?</b>
            <p>I probably won't know enough to give an opinion, I'm sorry! Hoever, if you have a question related to a current or previous interest, then ask away!</p><hr>
            <h2>Other</h2>
            <b>Where does the name "Bechno Kid" come from?</b>
            <p>My sister and her friend group came up with several nicknames for themselves. As a lonely middle-schooler, I always wanted a cool name. I originally went with "Techno Kid" but somewhere along the way, I went with "Bechno Kid".</p>
            <b>What does "Bechno" mean?</b>
            <p>It doesn't really mean anything! It's a word I made up, but I think it sounds pretty neat!</p>
