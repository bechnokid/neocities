        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>I've gotten a lot of questions over the years. Many of them are asked pretty often, which is why I created this page! If you have another question that you don't see on this page, feel free to <a href="mailto:bechnokid@yahoo.com">email me</a>.</p><hr>

            <dl id="faq-me"><dt>Where does the name "Bechno Kid" come from?</dt><dd>My sister and her friend group came up with several nicknames for themselves. As a lonely middle-schooler, I always wanted a cool name. I originally went with "Techno Kid" but somewhere along the way, I went with "Bechno Kid".</dd><dt>What does "Bechno" mean?</dt><dd>It doesn't really mean anything! It's a word I made up, but I think it sounds pretty neat!</dd></dl>

          <h2>Art</h2>
          <section>
            <dl id="faq-art"><dt>What kind of tools/software do you use for your art?</dt><dd>Clip Studio Paint with an Intuos Bamboo CTH-480 tablet for drawing, and Photoscape for any final edits!</dd><dt>When will you open commissions again?</dt><dd>I'm not sure, but I always make a post on all my social media sites before opening commissions!</dd><dt>Is there a way to support your work without commissioning you?</dt><dd>I have a <a href='https://ko-fi.com/A34588W' target='_new'>Ko-fi</a> if you'd like to donate! Otherwise, you can support me by blogging/retweeting my artwork (Tumblr/Twitter) or sharing this website!</dd><dt>Are you open for art trades/requests?</dt><dd>Due to my limited time, I cannot take any more art trades or requests! I might take suggestions if they are related to my current interests, but that is a big <i>"might"</i>.</dd><dt>Can I use your art for icons/headers/banners?</dt><dd>Definitely! As long as it's fanart (excluding gift art and commissions) and you give proper c redit, such as providing a link back to any of my socials. The only thing I ask is that you don't use art that contain any of my own characters, fan or original!</dd><dt>Can I trace your work?</dt><dd>Sure, but only if it's for practice! All I ask is that you don't post it publicly.</dd><dt>Can I draw fanart of your characters?</dt><dd>Absolutely! &lt;3  All I ask is that you don't draw anything NSFW or fetish-related.</dd><dt>Any chance you'll draw ______ again?</dt><dd>It's not likely if it's something I haven't  drawn in a while since my interests tend to fluctuate a lot.</dd></dl>

        <h2>Fandom</h2>
        <section>
          <dl id="faq-fandom"><dt>Have you watched/played/heard of ______?</dt><dd>Maybe, or maybe not! I'd rather not be asked these kinds of questions!</dd><dt>What do you think of ______?</dt><dd>I probably won't know enough to give an opinion, I'm sorry! However, if you have a question related to a current or previous interest, then ask away!</dd><dt>Are you a proshipper or an anti?</dt><dd>-shrugs- I'm not a fan of a lot of things that people consider to be problematic (incest, noncon, power imbalance, etc.). In fact, those topics make me extremely uncomfortable. However, I don't go out of my way to look for artists/writers to harass or send death threats to. The most I would do is report someone, but that's only if they are actively hurting people (i.e. grooming or abusing minors).</dd></dl>
