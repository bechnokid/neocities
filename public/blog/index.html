        <p>Welcome to my blog/journal/diary/etc.! Although I use my Twitter and Tumblr for semi-frequent updates, this will be a place where I either just want to vent or just let out any random thoughts I may have. There's also a dream diary here, if you're interested!</p>

        <h2>Dream Diary</h2>
        <article class="dream-diary">
          <dl>
            <dt>Nov. 29, 2022</dt>
            <dd>I saw Spamton in a kid's TV show, and I remember being like, "Whoa, I wonder how they portrayed him!" From what I can remember, it was basically a detective who is helping Spamton get back on his feet. It was kind of like the human/cartoon dynamic from that old 90s cartoon "Bonkers".</dd>
            <dt>Nov. 13, 2022</dt>
            <dd>The Avengers were righting some bad guys in a warehouse! I remember being sad that I couldn't see Doctor Strange, but I got to see him at the end, yay!</dd>
            <dt>Nov. 11, 2022</dt>
            <dd>I apparently suffered burns throughout my entire body, so I had to wrap myself up in bandages while my mom was trying to find a cure for me. We were in outer space looking around in other treatment centers only to be turned away because they "didn't take Earthlings". I got better!</dd>
            <dt>Oct. 12, 2022</dt>
            <dd>There was a young girl who looked like Alice from "Alice in Wonderland", and she was...trying to take one of Sinister Strange's desks? He looked pretty confused about this weird girl wanting his desk, but she kept insisting he trade it with some of her possessions, saying "If he's not going to use it, then it'd be a waste!" She made a good point, but...?</dd>
            <dt>Oct. 8, 2022</dt>
            <dd>I was on another Disney, but this time there were mostly Marvel characters. I hear there is an actual cruise that's just Marvel characters (I think it's called "Marvel at Sea"?), but EITHER WAY, I got to see Doctor Strange and talk to him a bit! I forgot what we talked about, but I was super glad to see him :3333</dd>
            <dt>Sep. 25, 2022</dt>
            <dd>It was a pretty scary dream this time around. The city where I'm living in was ravaged by a realy bad storm. The roads were completely broken and flooded to the point that my spouses and I had to take boat to D.C. to find some shelter. I was trying to contact my parents with my phone but it was at like 1% and I didn't bring a charger with me in my panic. So, I couldn't contact them to let them know how I was doing. I was able to wake up, but oh man...that was scary!</dd>
            <dt>Sep. 24, 2022</dt>
            <dd>I had a long series of dreams, but one that stood out to me was that I was riding a bicycle and was easily able to pop a wheelie. I can barely ride on my own in real life lol. Another thing I particularly remember was that I was still in collage despite having graduated in 2017. There was a guy that was suffering a major panic attack, and I brought him over to the nurse's office. However, the nurses were completely dismissive, and I called them out for not doing their jobs. I felt pretty proud of myself, but I wasn't sure why I dreamt it.</dd>
            <dt>Sep. 22, 2022</dt>
            <dd>Nothing like starting off a dream diary than to mention that I had a dream about Doctor Strange. I don't remember much more after that, but it was pretty cool. B)</dd>
