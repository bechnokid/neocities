              <p>Haha sorry, I couldn't help but make a small reference to SPYxFAMILY. It's a really good anime that I started watching with my spouses lately.<br/><br/>
  
                But anyway!!<br/><br/>
    
                We went to a company picnic a few hours ago, and it was pretty nice. It was cloudy, but it was still really hot, and we were pretty sure that it was going to rain if we were to stay there any longer. My wife felt pretty bad because we drove about 40 minutes to the picnic, only to go home after eating one plate of food. But my husband and I reassured her that it's ok! We can't really help it if the weather was already pretty awful.<br/><br/>
    
                It was nice to actually go out and meet new people, even if we're all horribly introverted. x3 Still, it would be nice to do some events like this more often once the virus becomes more manageable!<br/><br/>
    
                In the meantime, at least I ate a really good hot dog! They had burgers and hot dogs, and I was really tempted to get both, but I had to make sure I stay within my diet, and if I had to choose one, it would be a hot dog!<br/><br/>
                That's it for me tonight, have a good one!</p>
