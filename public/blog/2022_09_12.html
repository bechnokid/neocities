              <p>On August 26<sup>th</sup>, I embarked on a life-changing journey.</p>
              <p>A journey...</p>
              <p>...on a Disney cruise.</p>
              <p>I was unsure about going on a Disney cruise with my parents and my sister since I abhor travelling, and the fact that my family was a huge source of my trauma and anxiety for nearly twenty years. "Unsure" is an understatement, actually. I broke down multiple times weeks before the dreaded date lol.</p>
              <p>Thoughts raced through my head as I assumed the worst possibilities possible: fighting/arguing with my sister and parents, my parents judging me for my lifestyles and my current relationship with my two spouses, my sister dismissing/invalidating me, my parents spoiling and doting on my sister because she's a doctor now, etc.</p>
              <p>Thankfully...none of that happened, and I had an absolutely wonderful time there.</p>
              <p>I ate delicious food, watched several fantastic live shows, and overall had a really relaxing time just doing nothing while my sister would go out touring the areas around the ports we stopped at. There were also some times where I had some heart-to-heart conversations with my parents, which I think wouldn't have been possible if we didn't go on this cruise.</p>
              <p>Sure, my parents aren't the best and I was hurt a lot of times, but they <b>did</b> their best and they're still <b>doing</b> their best, and that's something I'm truly grateful for. My parents showed that they're still growing and learning, even at their old age. They've been supportive of my polyamorous relationship with my spouses despite all of us being Catholic. My sister remained relatively the same, but she surprised me in some ways, such as comforting and hugging me after I realized I lost my Switch and promptly broke down (I found it, though!). We even got to gossip about her classmates in her residency. It was great.</p>
              <p>I'm honestly pretty lucky to have the parents that I have. I know that it's pretty common to complain about our parents here online, but idk. The trauma I had to experience growing up might never go away, but at least it hurts a lot less now after getting to meet up with my family and seeing just how much they changed for the better. I actually got a proper apology from them, too. It's funny that a Disney cruise would be the place where I finally got some closure for all of the pain I had to endure in the past.</p>
              <p>As much as I hate traveling, the cruise more than made up for it.</p>
              <p>I also got to see <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> <b>five</b> times, but I'll gush about him in another blog post lol.</p></div>
