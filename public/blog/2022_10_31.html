            <p>This will be a short blog entry since I'm still going through the stages of grief, but I want to at least do something for one of my favorite holidays of the year!</p>
            <p>I wasn't able to create a Halloween page on my site since I was working on Strangetober, but I was so excited to see what other folks have done for the holiday. This is my first Halloween on Neocities, and needless to say, I was really excited.</p>

            <h2>Doctor Dizzy's Halloween Adventure 2022</h2>
            <p>The first thing I did was play <a href="https://doctordizzy.neocities.org/halloween/" target="_new">Dizzy's Halloween game</a>. It is one of the first text-based games I've ever played. I know I played some when I was younger, but none of them really stood out to me like Dizzy's did. I won't spoil anything, but I had a lot of fun hanging out with the characters in the game. Thank you for making it, Dizzy! I look forward to more!</p>

            <h2>Kreepy Key's Halloween Horrortorium</h2>
            <p>The next thing I did was visit <a href="https://kreepykeys.neocities.org/trickortreat.html" target="_new">Key's Halloween shrine</a>, which is an absolute blast in itself. What more can I say about how delightfully spooky this was? The bowl creeped me out a bit, but then again, isn't that the point of Halloween? xD Thanks again for the candy, Key!</p>

            <p>That's it for the spooky festivities, but I can't wait for next year! As for me, I hope we get some Trick-or-Treaters this year, but I hear it might rain. That's ok, though! More candy for me!</p>
            <p>I hope all of you have a happy Halloween!</p>
