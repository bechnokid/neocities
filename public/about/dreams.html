            Apparently, it's a thing to have a dream diary of sorts! I mostly forget my dreams (or have nightmares), but maybe putting them down in a log would be interesting.

              <p>It was a pretty scary dream this time around. The city where I'm living in was ravaged by a realy bad storm. The roads were completely broken and flooded to the point that my spouses and I had to take boat to D.C. to find some shelter. I was trying to contact my parents with my phone but it was at like 1% and I didn't bring a charger with me in my panic. So, I couldn't contact them to let them know how I was doing. I was able to wake up, but oh man...that was scary!</p>
              <h2>Sep. 24, 2022</h2>
              <p>I had a long series of dreams, but one that stood out to me was that I was riding a bicycle and was easily able to pop a wheelie. I can barely ride on my own in real life lol. Another thing I particularly remember was that I was still in collage despite having graduated in 2017. There was a guy that was suffering a major panic attack, and I brought him over to the nurse's office. However, the nurses were completely dismissive, and I called them out for not doing their jobs. I felt pretty proud of myself, but I wasn't sure why I dreamt it.</p>
              <h2>Sep. 22, 2022</h2>
              <p>Nothing like starting off a dream diary than to mention that I had a dream about Doctor Strange. I don't remember much more after that, but it was pretty cool. B)</p>
