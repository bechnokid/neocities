            <div class="content-main">
              <p>As we get older, it's common to yearn for the old, simpler times. When people talk about the "good ol' days", they usually talk about the days when they were more ignorant of the world around them, and that's not a bad thing sometimes. You know what they say, <i>"ignorance is bliss"</i>. In these hard times, we are finding ourselves wanting to go back to those times, such as purchasing walkmans and tapes, record players with their respective vinyl records, or even wanting to purchase old keyboards used in the 80s/90s <i>(that's me...I want these old keyboards)</i>.<br><br>I don't personally have an interest in going back to the old days as I am very happy with who I am today. Sure, the world may suck and it continues to get worse with every passing year, but I'd say it's even worse to stay in this delusion that the old days were better when they really weren't. Although fighting for gender equality and gay rights has always been a thing, it has thankfully become more normalized in recent years compared to say...the 50's. As an Asian-American, it's honestly so relieving to not constantly see a white man as the main hero on TV anymore.<br><br>But I'm getting off-track here.<br><br>The reason why I'm writing this manifesto is because Web 1.0 (or the old Web) is actually a valid part of "the old days" that we need to return to.<br><br>As we journeyed through the Web 2.0 and are slowly approaching Web 3.0, it's become sadly apparent that individuality and the userbase are not as valuable anymore; it's all about selling. Social media has continued to remove more options for users to customize and make their page truly their own. Programming and web design is more important than ever...but only if it helps a company get more money.<br><br>I can't tell you how disheartening it is, seeing more and more users lose their ability to program because they simply don't have the time for it anymore. If they want to make money, why spend hours on learning how to use HTML and CSS when you can just have a website built for you? It's come to a point where users have become entirely reliant on web-buidler services that will sacrifice any kind of individuality to build "professional" websites to help users sell their products and services.<br><br>If there are any social media sites that can be used, they are mostly used to promote, promote, promote so users can sell, sell, sell. So, why bother with customizing your profile when you can just add an avatar and header and call it a day? It's so easy now!<br><br>I admit that I am also very guilty of this, constantly trying to promote my artwork and get as many followers as possible when this wasn't even my full-time job in the first place. I thought of using Squarespace to have a website built for me at some point, which was ironic considering I'm a <b>software programmer</b>. I'm in the process of getting rid of my bad habits of using social media to validate my existence. I don't want to have to depend on the number of likes on an art post if I want to feel important. I have a wife and husband who make me feel important <i>EVERY DAY!!</i><br><br>I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir with this manifesto. I mean, almost every one I've read has already covered why Web 1.0 is important <i>(which I will provide in the below section! Give them a read!! :3)</i>, but I at least wanted to share my own experiences. I don't know if we can truly go back to Web 1.0, but with the rise of Neocities sites run by old and new generations alike, I have a lot of hope!</p><hr>
