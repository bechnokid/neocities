        <h1>Bech-NOW</h1>
        <p>Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a>, I think it'd be nice to make this page!</p><hr>

          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <section>
            <p><b>Software developer</b> and <b>semi-professional artist</b>.</p><p>By day, I am a full-stack software developer, which means that I work on both the backend (the coding) and the frontend (UI) of the application that I'm assigned to. It's fun and I'm learning new things every day. </p><p>By night (and weekends), I am an artist who enjoys drawing but am usually too tired to get anything done that night, so I usually end up playing video games lol. But that's ok. I'm in no rush to draw/post anything for my social media profiles.</p>
            <p>I have done a total of three small gigs for an animation project, two of which include <a href="/writing/2022_12_03.html">designing t-shirts</a>. I think that's a pretty big accomplishment!</p>

          <h2>Where am I?</h2>
          <section>
            <p>I currently live on the <b>east coast of the United States</b>. I have no plans on moving anywhere else except for maybe a better house that's a bit closer to where I work. Otherwise, I'm quite comfortable here.</p><p>We are currently in the process of getting our storm door fixed after a stray rock shattered the entire thing. Our next plan is to fix the chimney so that we're not at risk of setting our house on fire. We don't even use the fireplace, but better safe than sorry. Our current dream is to have our backyard and deck renovated into a place where we can hang outside at our bonfire...playing video games. Some things never change with us.</p><p>Online...I barely have a presence. I'm mostly retweeting interesting or funny things I see on Twitter and talk to a few friends through DMs. Despite being a member of several Discord servers, I'm barely online as it is. It kinda sucks that a lot of important or useful information is locked behind walls of nearly unsearchable text. I miss forums.</p>

          <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>Art</h3>
            <ul><li>I want to make the time to draw some comics related to my <b>Yokai Watch OC</b> and the shenanigans she's gotteninto :3 I have a lot of ideas in mind for 4-koma comics!</li><li>There is also a <b>color wheel challenge</b> going on at Twitter and I'm excited to participate. I'm thinking of making two versions where one only pertains to my interests and the other would be suggestions from followers. It'll be fun as long as I remember to pace myself!</li><li>Currently filling out a very old DeviantArt meme. It's taken me a few days now, but like I said, I'm pacing myself! It's been a lot of fun!</li><li>I'm also hoping to make some references of two of my Monster Hunter OCs. Ok...one is based on an existing fictional character, but he still counts...I think?</li></ul>
            <h3>Site</h3>
            <ul><li>Still working on uploading 2016 art into this site! It's taking a while because I drew A LOT when I was in school.</li><li>Another small project is converting a wholesome game on Tumblr into Javascript for fun and to preserve its positivity.</li></ul>

            <h3>Personal</h3>
            <ul><li>I bought a special keyboard!! I'll write some more about it in a blog post.</li><li>I learned about minimalist/barefoot shoes and how most modern shoes restrict our toes, which can have lasting health issues in the long run, so I'm thinking of getting a pair of transitional ones to help out my poor feet. Or maybe I should just stick to wearing toe separators each day to save money haha</li></ul>
