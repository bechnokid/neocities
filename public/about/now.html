        <h1>Bech-NOW</h1>
        <p>Inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">nownownow.com</a>, I think it'd be nice to make this page!</p><hr>

          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <section>
            <p><b>Software developer</b> and <b>semi-professional artist</b>.</p><p>By day, I am a full-stack software developer, which means that I work on both the backend (the coding) and the frontend (UI) of the application that I'm assigned to. It's fun and I'm learning new things every day. </p><p>By night (and weekends), I am an artist who enjoys drawing but am usually too tired to get anything done that night, so I usually end up playing video games lol. But that's ok. I'm in no rush to draw/post anything for my social media profiles.</p>
            <p>I have done a total of three small gigs for an animation project, two of which include <a href="/writing/2022_12_03.html">designing t-shirts</a>. I think that's a pretty big accomplishment!</p>
          </section>
          <h2>Where am I?</h2>
          <section>
            <p>I currently live on the <b>east coast of the United States</b> and am fairly close to Washington D.C. I have no plans on moving anywhere else except for maybe a better house that's a bit closer to where I work. Otherwise, I'm quite comfortable here.</p><p>We've been slowly getting home improvements done, with the most recent being our roofing. Our next plan is to fix the chimney so that we're not at risk of setting our house on fire. We don't even use the fireplace, but better safe than sorry. Our current dream is to have our backyard and deck renovated into a place where we can hang outside at our bonfire...playing video games. Some things never change with us.</p><p>Online...I barely have a presence. I'm mostly retweeting interesting or funny things I see on Twitter and talk to a few friends through DMs. Despite being a member of several Discord servers, I'm barely online as it is. It kinda sucks that a lot of important or useful information is locked behind walls of nearly unsearchable text. I miss forums.</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Art</h3>
            <ul><li>I want to make the time to draw some comics related to my <b>Yokai Watch OC</b> and the shenanigans she's gotteninto :3 I have a lot of ideas in mind for 4-koma comics!</li><li>There is also a <b>color wheel challenge</b> going on at Twitter and I'm excited to participate. I'm thinking ofmaking two versions where one only pertains to my interests and the other would be suggestions from followers. It'llbe fun as long as I remember to pace myself!</li><li>Currently filling out a very old DeviantArt meme. It's taken me a few days now, but like I said, I'm pacing myself! It's been a lot of fun!</li><li>I'm also hoping to make some references of two of my Monster Hunter OCs. Ok...one is based on an existing fictional character, but he still counts...I think?</li></ul>
            <h3>Site</h3>
            <ul><li>Still working on uploading 2016 art into this site! It's taking a while because I drew A LOT when I was in school.</li><li>Another small project is converting a wholesome game on Tumblr into Javascript for fun and to preserve its positivity.</li><li>I'd also like to implement a better way of uploading my art. I think <a href="https://palemomos.bearblog.dev/add-a-gallery-with-hundreds-of-images-easily-to-your-website-using-javascript-or-jquery/">Pale's tutorial</a> might be really useful for this. >:3</li></ul>

            <ul><li>We recently started doing a pedometer challenge at work, and I'm using this as an opportunity to get healthier and improve my stamina! One day I will climb stairs without getting so tired!</li><li>I've also been trying to make some more time to improve my cooking. The tomato basil soup at the cafeteria changed my life, and I need to remake that recipe.</li></ul>
