<p>It's finally gotten a little cooler!</p><p>You know, I can never decide if I like fall or winter better. I always seem to flip-flop between the two. I just like colder weather in general! Not that I can tolerate the cold, but rather, I like to bundle up and wear lots of layers since I never like to show my skin much.</p><p>Here's what's in this update!</p><ul><li>New page: <a href="/pocket_bishies">Pocket Bishies</a>!<ul><li>I've seen it around, but I never really made a page until now! The collection might stay small since I'm not a huge nerd and the original sites have long stopped working/updating. It is what it is!</li><li>If you have JavaScript enabled, you can take a few quizzes to nab some bishies of your own! I won't be taking submissions like the original sites did, but I still hope you enjoy them!</li></ul></li><li>New art in the <a href="/art/ff">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="/art/digimon">Digimon</a> sections!</li><li>Added 4 <a href="/goodies/adopts">adopts</a></li><li>Some front-end and back-end fixes, including:<ul><li>Made the guestbook form more accessible</li><li>Updated the main page to resize itself automatically if certain parts of the navigation are opened. It isn't perfect since I want to avoid using JavaScript in the navigation, but it looks pretty good!</li><li>Shortened the links for art, changing them from &quot;artwork&quot; to &quot;art&quot;</li><li>Updated <a href="/joined">Webrings</a> to use less JavaScript in general. Not sure if I succeeded, but it's something!</li></ul></li></ul><p>That's it for now, see you all next update!</p>
