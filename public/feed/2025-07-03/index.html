<p>Small update this time around, but I hope everyone has been doing ok! The dreadful heat (and other horrors) persist, but so do I!</p><p>Here's what's in this update!</p><ul><li>Updated the <a href="/now">now</a> page</li><li>Made some fixes and cosmetic changes throughout the site, including making the header and navigation sidebar fixed in place in desktop mode! Viewing them on mobile should have no effect, or at least I hope not!! <img class="inline-img" src="/assets/images/blog/emoticon/emote_embarrassed.png" aria-hidden="true" alt=""></li></ul>
