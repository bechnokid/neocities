<p>Hello! I hope everyone is doing alright! It's almost the weekend!</p><p>For this update, I added some more <a href="/links">links</a>, and I changed the URL for all blog entries. The dates being all bunched up confused me more than anything lol...</p><p>I'm also biting the bullet and added some <a href="/joined">webrings</a> despite not having officially joined them yet! Here I was worred about looking like a desperate fool, and yet I have I added a special widget to the <a href="/home">home page</a> to count the days I'm pulling for a cookie in Cookie Run: Kingdom lol.</p><p>Burning Spice Cookie, please come to my kingdom!!!</p>
