<p>I've been starting to see more shops selling pumpkin spice-flavored snacks, so that means Fall is officially here (I think)!</p><p>Here's the spice in today's update!</p><ul><li>Brought back the <a href="/quiz_results">Quiz Results</a> page! Since I have a lot of space for more images, I thought it'd be nice to bring it back!</li><li>Fixed up the installation guide for the <a href="/resources/status-cafe/themes/dA2006">deviantART Status Cafe theme</a>! The tables disappeared in the previous update, so I brought them back!</li><li>Added two cliques to the home page: <a href="https://lockheart.love/collections/cliques">Cutie Connections</a> and <a href="https://ac.kuchiki.net/">pixel friends</a></li><li>Added <a href="/goodies/adopts">one adopt</a> for others to adopt! Admittedly, I didn't make it. I just revised the colors and other parts of it, but I still love it enough to share!</li><li>There is now a secret page in the site! Can you find it? :3</li><li>Various updates and fixes to help make the site a little bit better, such as adding navigation buttons in some pages.</li></ul><p>That's it for now! See you later!</p>
