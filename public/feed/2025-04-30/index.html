<p>Hi there! I decided to bring back the <a href="/now">/now</a> page.</p><p>There is also an <a href="/accessibility">accessibility statement</a>! I really want to make it clear that I'm trying to make my website as accessible as possible! It won't be perfect, but at least my site works on mobile!</p>
