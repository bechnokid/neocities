<p>Happy <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/20/festival-of-accord-dreamspell-comes-to-monster-hunter-wilds-starting-october-22/">Dreamspell Festival</a> Eve! I honestly wish I would make more of a habit uploading my art here as soon as I finish drawing it, but I love making updates to the site as well! <img class="inline-img" src="/assets/images/blog/emoticon/emote_happy.png" aria-hidden="true" alt=""></p><p>Here are the spooky changes for this update:</p><ul><li>New artwork in the <a href="/art/digimon">Digimon</a> section</li><li>Added a new <a href="/links">link</a></li><li>Added back the <a href="/resources/code-snippets">code snippets</a> page! The old snippets are no longer there, but there are some new ones! Check them out if you'd like! I'm hoping to update this a little more frequently!</li><li>The <a href="/goodies/pixel_clubs">pixel club</a> page got a revamp for easier viewing, and I added the Bottlecaps pixel club!</li><li>Added some <a href="/goodies/graphics">honeycomb stamp</a> graphics! I had been meaning to add them for a while, but making the CSS took a little bit of work!</li><li>Cosmetic updates and other fixes, including:<ul><li>Added a loading screen to graphic-heavy pages</li><li>I removed most of the <i class="ft-alert-triangle index"></i> icons as a result, but only if JS is enabled! They are still there if JS is disabled!</li><li>Added <a href="/sitemap">sitemap</a> to the navigation sidebar for easier access</li></ul></li></ul><p>That's it for now! See you later, and I hope everyone has a great Halloween in 10 days!</p>
