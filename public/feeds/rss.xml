      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Happy New Year everyone! Today is also the day that the long-awaited version 3.0 of Animal Crossing New Horizons is released! I hope everyone has fun with it.</p>
<p>There are some pretty big updates today:</p>
<ul>
<li>New artwork in the <a href="/art/game">Games</a> section! This is technically a crossover piece, but I don't have enough to make a new section yet lol</li>
<li>New page: <a href="/me/fan">Fangirling</a>, a page that's just me rambling about my experiences and preferences as a fan of media!</li>
<li><a href="/resources/status-cafe/themes">Status Cafe themes</a>:
<ul>
<li>Did a huge rehaul by improving how a theme is previewed and installing a button that will copy the code to your clipboard, making it easy to just paste it into the text box for the <strong>About</strong> section,</li>
<li>Added a new theme! Those from Neocities in 2022-2023 might recognize it lol. I'm being a little shameless with this one hehe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added some more links! The more links I move from my bookmarks to this page, the more cool websites I keep finding. This is what I love about the indie web hehe.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now. I hope everyone has a great day!</p>

        <p>Hi everyone! I hope everyone has had a good time during the winter holidays. This will be the last update for the year. :D</p>
<p>There are so many changes in this update that I'm not sure if I can put them all in this single entry without it being too overwhelming. XD</p>
<p>So, I'll list the most important ones (to me)!</p>
<ul>
<li>New artwork in the <a href="/art/digimon">Digimon</a> section</li>
<li>Made a <a href="/to-do">to-do</a> list for the site</li>
<li>Added two <a href="/links">links</a></li>
<li>Meadow's guestbook service is currently down, so I linked to my <a href="https://bechnokid.atabook.org/">atabook</a> instead. Hopefully it gets fixed soon!</li>
<li>Optimization updates (hopefully):
<ul>
<li>Consolidated most of my JS files into one</li>
<li>Fixed up JS for webrings page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>Hi everyone! It's another cold day in December. We actually had one snow day here! We sadly haven't had snow since then, but I'm holding out hop that it will snow on Christmas!</p>
<p>This update seems pretty small, but that's because most of the updates were on the back end! However, an update is still an update!</p>
<p>Here are the latest changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new clique: <a href="https://crystallizing.neocities.org">Crystallizing</a>. Yes, I chose that gem specifically because of that one animanga, teehee.</li>
<li>Updated <a href="/feeds">RSS</a> and made into page that holds other feeds</li>
<li>Cosmetic updates including:
<ul>
<li>Unifying colors, especially colors for links</li>
<li>Updated <a href="/not_found">404 page</a> image to better match my current look</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Backend updates and fixes including:
<ul>
<li>Minifying and bundling CSS for optimization (hopefully the CSS is still readable to use as reference!)</li>
<li>Updated CSS and JS code for Freezeframe script thanks to <a href="https://friendshaped.garden">FriendShapedPlant</a>!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now! See you next time!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Hello, everyone! It's almost the end of November, which for a lot of you, means the beginning of winter holidays! I live in the US, so we have Thanksgiving coming up next week. I'm not sure what my family and I will be doing on that day, but I know that we don't usually have turkey!</p>
<p>It's gotten even colder for us here in the Northern Hemisphere. For those in the Southern Hemisphere, I hope you're all enjoying some warm weather! I wonder what it's like to celebrate Christmas in the Southern Hemisphere...</p>
<p>Here are the changes for this update!</p>
<ul>
<li>Completed a <a href="/writing/blog/2025-11-20">100-question survey for webmasters</a>!</li>
<li>Added some more <a href="/goodies/adopts">adopts</a> as well as some that are orphaned.
<ul>
<li>I browsed through a lot of old pixel sites thanks to <a href="https://kawaiiattic.arunyi.art/">Kawaii Attic</a>, and I noticed that there were special adopts that webmasters had that people can sign up or pay to adopt. Since the sites that adopted them went down or the adopts never went up for sale, I took it upon myself to collect some of them and put them up for adoption here!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added more <a href="/quiz-results">quiz results</a>.</li>
<li>Added some <a href="/links">links</a> as well as removed some that are dead/inactive.</li>
<li>Added a ton of web cliques on home and in <a href="/joined">/joined</a>. They're so much fun!</li>
<li>Updated the layout for the <a href="/curses">curses generator</a>. I don't have any new ones, yet, but I'm hoping to add more! <img class='inline-img' src='/assets/images/blog/emoticon/emote_wink.png' aria-hidden='true' alt=''></li>
<li>Updated my <a href="/about">/about</a> page to talk less about my job. I realize I've been saying, &quot;Yeah, I'm a <em>software developer</em>&quot; a lot, which I imagine makes me sound pretty pretentious. <img class='inline-img' src='/assets/images/blog/emoticon/emote_embarrassed.png' aria-hidden='true' alt=''></li>
<li>Responsiveness changes including:
<ul>
<li>Making the site look better on tablets, such as iPads, Kindles, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cosmetic changes including:
<ul>
<li>Adding colors for links that have been visited. This should make it a bit easier for users to tell which links they have already visited. If you're someone like me who cleans up her history every week, this might not be entirely useful to you, but still!</li>
<li>Changing the images for my favorite characters in my <a href="/about">/about</a> page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bug fixes including:
<ul>
<li>Fixing broken links in sitemap</li>
<li>Fixed spacing issues in a lot of pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now. Stay warm (or stay cool if in the Southern Hemisphere)!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[
        <p>Hello, everyone! I hope all of you are doing alright and that seasonal depression has passed for you. If not, then you can do it! I believe in you!</p>
<p>It's gotten colder, but thankfully I like colder weather! It means I can bundle up, wear my longer coats, and look like a real anime protagonist! Ok, not really...</p>
<p>Here are the changes for this update!</p>
<ul>
<li>New artwork in the <a href="/art/digimon">Digimon</a> and <a href="/art/anime">Anime</a> sections</li>
<li>Added a section with my currently active social media accounts in <a href="/links">Links</a></li>
<li>New <a href="/blog">blog</a> entry where I talk about my grievances with sites that repost graphics without giving credit to the original artists</li>
<li>Finally decided to join more <a href="/joined">fanlistings</a>!</li>
<li>Cosmetic updates including:
<ul>
<li>Updating the dark mode colors</li>
<li>Adding an icon after external links as well as changing the text color</li>
<li>Figuring out how to add line numbers to code blocks for future snippets. This will help in pointing specific lines in any code I share!</li>
<li>Moving the Play/Stop GIFs buttons to the navigation bar for easier access</li>

        &lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone! I hope all of you are doing alright and that seasonal depression has passed for you. If not, then you can do it! I believe in you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s gotten colder, but thankfully I like colder weather! It means I can bundle up, wear my longer coats, and look like a real anime protagonist! Ok, not really...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the changes for this update!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New artwork in the &lt;a href=&quot;/art/digimon&quot;&gt;Digimon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/art/anime&quot;&gt;Anime&lt;/a&gt; sections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a section with my currently active social media accounts in &lt;a href=&quot;/links&quot;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New &lt;a href=&quot;/blog&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; entry where I talk about my grievances with sites that repost graphics without giving credit to the original artists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally decided to join more &lt;a href=&quot;/joined&quot;&gt;fanlistings&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cosmetic updates including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating the dark mode colors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding an icon after external links as well as changing the text color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out how to add line numbers to code blocks for future snippets. This will help in pointing specific lines in any code I share!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving the Play/Stop GIFs buttons to the navigation bar for easier access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a section dedicated to links that don&#39;t have buttons. I encourage others to visit those links!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now. See you all next time!&lt;/p&gt;
