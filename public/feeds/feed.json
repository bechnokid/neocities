I hope everyone has fun with it.</p>\n<p>There are some pretty big updates today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New artwork in the <a href=\"/art/game\">Games</a> section! This is technically a crossover piece, but I don't have enough to make a new section yet lol</li>\n<li>New page: <a href=\"/me/fan\">Fangirling</a>, a page that's just me rambling about my experiences and preferences as a fan of media!</li>\n<li><a href=\"/resources/status-cafe/themes\">Status Cafe themes</a>:\n<ul>\n<li>Did a huge rehaul by improving how a theme is previewed and installing a button that will copy the code to your clipboard, making it easy to just paste it into the text box for the <strong>About</strong> section,</li>\n<li>Added a new theme! Those from Neocities in 2022-2023 might recognize it lol. I'm being a little shameless with this one hehe.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Added some more links! The more links I move from my bookmarks to this page, the more cool websites I keep finding. This is what I love about the indie web hehe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's it for now. I hope everyone has a great day!</p>\n",
