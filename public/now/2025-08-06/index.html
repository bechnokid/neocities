I've been enjoying it so far, but I don't want to get too used to this lifestyle! <img class="inline-img" src="/assets/images/blog/emoticon/emote_embarrassed.png" aria-hidden="true" alt=""> I need to make sure I get enough sun and that I am diligent in any sort of workout routine!</li><li>I learned how to make the perfect hard-boiled eggs, thanks to Sam! They're so good!! With how expensive eggs have become, they've become a nice treat to have every now and then.</li></ul></section><section><h3 id="playing" tabindex="-1">Playing</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a><ul><li>Participating in the Flamefete Festival has been so fun!!
